# Switch Network To Binance Smart Chain

![1](/img/tutorial/bnb.png)



## Step 1. Configuring the wallet

You might notice straight away that we’re still dealing with an **Ethereum wallet**. At best, this won’t work with Binance Smart Chain DApps. At worst, you could lose funds by sending them to addresses you can’t actually use.

Let’s change that. We want to access the Settings to point the wallet towards Binance Smart Chain nodes.

`Select Settings from the dropdown menu.`

On the Settings page, we want to locate the Networks menu.

We want to click **Add Network** in the top-right corner to **manually add the Binance Smart Chain** one – it doesn’t come packaged with MetaMask. It’s important to note that there are two networks we can use here: the testnet or the mainnet. Below are the parameters to fill in for each.

- Mainnet
- Network Name: Smart Chain
- New RPC URL: https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/
- ChainID: 56
- Symbol: BNB
- Block Explorer URL: https://bscscan.com

Once you Save the Network and return to the main view, you’ll notice two things: the network has automatically been set to the one you just entered, and the units are no longer denominated in ETH, but in BNB.

:::tip TIP!
Don’t let the Ethereum logo fool you – we’ve tuned into the BSC.

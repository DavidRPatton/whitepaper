## Step 2. Create an Setup

MetaMask is a very easy wallet to get started with. No email address or personal identification is required. The process consists of two main steps - creating a password and backing up your seed phrase. You will be ready to explore the world of Crypto in just a few minutes.

MetaMask supports any token built on the Crypto blockchains. You might come across terms such as ERC-20,ERC-721, or BEP-20; these are just types of tokens.

The first step is to create your password and set up your login settings
- MetaMask cannot reset your password for you. Check the checkbox to confirm you understand this concept. If you want to reset your password, you will need your seed phase
- Create your password using a combination of upper and lower case, numbers, and symbols. It's recommended to use a unique password that you have not used before.
- Sign in with Biometrics? MetaMask supports biometric authentication if enabled on your device. Decide if you want to use biometric authentication with your MetaMask account by switching the toggle on/off.
- When finished - tap on `Create password`

**Click Reveal Secret Words**. There you will see a 12 words seed phrase. This is really important and usually not a good idea to store digitally, so take your time and write it down.




## Step 3. Verify your seed phrase

At this point, you will have a fully functioning cryptocurrency wallet that is able to store, send, and receive cryptocurrency. Before you put funds in your wallet, you need to verify and create a backup of your seed phrase. Your seed phrase is the only way to restore access to your funds if you lose access to your wallet - backing up your seed phrase is a very important step. 

:::danger WARNING
 When you follow the steps to find your seed phrase, you will be writing the seed phrase on a piece of paper. It is very important that you save this seed phrase in as many places as possible. If you lose this phrase you will never gain access to your wallet again and all of your funds will be lost forever!

Secure Your Wallet - This is the most important step in creating your wallet.

MetaMask will give you two options on the `Secure Your Wallet` screen.

- `Start (Highly recommend)`← This is the one you want to select

MetaMask will display a warning before displaying your seed phrase:

- Writing your seed phrase on paper comes with risks!
- Tap on `Start` after you finish reading the warnings

:::tip Reminder!
MetaMask reminds you on the last screen that it can't recover your wallet so that you have to back up your seed phrase in a safe way, It's your responsibility and an ultra-important task! Leaving a hint where you saved your backup is a good idea, but be careful of revealing the location of backup in a direct way, use something that no one can interpret, and of course, don't paste in your seed phrase.

# Metamask & Trust Wallet

- To start buying, selling, or trading **ALT Coins** (a non mainstream coin like Bitcoin or Ethereum ) you first need a crypto wallet that is not on an exchange. 

- An example of an exchange is like **Crypto.com** or **Coinbase.com**. You can not use these for alt coins unless that coin/token is listed on the exchange. 

- This is why you must learn to use an external crypto wallets such as **Metamask** or **Trust Wallet**. There are others out there but we are going to focus on just these two.

- You will also need to switch your crypto network in **Metamask** to **Binance(BNB)**.

### What you'll need

- Desktop/Laptop Computer
- Android Phone/Device
- Apple Phone/Device

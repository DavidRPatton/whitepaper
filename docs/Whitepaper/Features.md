## Why Invest in VICTORY?


Holding **VICTORY** gives you rewards in any coin/token you want, through an innovative reflections system. You can choose up to 6 **DIFFERENT** coins/tokens at once. Most projects give you rewards in their native token while others are limited to only one specific token. 
**Not US!** 

We give you the option to claim your rewards in any coin of your choosing as long as it's on the token list! That being said, the community will get to **Vote** on what tokens/coins make it on this list. This can be anywhere from a popular one like Safemoon to a new just launched one. The choice is yours!


## Veteran Donations

Victory was created by Veterans for Veterans. We wanted to start a one of a kind project that could not only help people out financially but also help Veterans from all over the world! Each month we will create a list for the community to vote on. This list will be 5-10 different Veterans Organizations from around the world. Once an organization is voted for we will donate to them. 

## Rewards

54% of every taxed buy  and 40% of every sell tax  is taken and redistributed to all holders. All you need to do to start earning is hold VICTORY in your wallet.

A Minimum of 1,000,000 tokens is required in order to receive rewards. The more you hold, the more you receive.

Rewards are claimed to your wallet via our innovative Reward Dapp and are paid on pegged BEP20 tokens on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). In periods of lower volume this might take a bit longer, but you always get all your rewards.



## Safety

Initial liquidity provided is locked with PinkLock for 3 years. This makes it impossible to block user transactions and do a rugpull. In addition to this 8% of all transactions will be allocated to 1) providing liquidity and 2) purchasing industry-standard Audit services, so that we have constant price appreciation and security. 

The contract has passed several Mythx security scans and weâ€™ll do CertiK and other audits as soon as possible.


## Self Sufficient and Ever Growing
1% of every transaction is allocated to marketing investments designed to achieve a continuous and sustainable growth. So we can fuel the most ambitious marketing efforts and reward our active community. 

Having a dedicated marketing budget allows for continuous growth in a sustainable manner. 

Additionally, 5% of every transaction is converted into liquidity for Pancakeswap. This is done automatically and helps create a rising price floor and stability.

## Anti Dump System
In order to avoid **pump & dumps** and **price manipulation** by **whales**, we have added an **anti-dump system** in which the largest holders cannot sell all their tokens at once and can only sell **70%** at a time.

 All transactions will be limited to a maximum of **100M tokens.**

## How many VICTORY tokens do I need to earn rewards?
You need 1,000,000 tokens. 

## Will my rewards always be paid daily?
Our reward system is triggered by volume (buy + sell activity to cover gas fees) and payouts to holders are expected to occur as frequently as every 60 minutes, but might take longer if trading volume is low. When this is the case, the amount of rewards each holder will receive does not decrease and will accrue over a longer period of time until it is suitable for a payout to trigger (usually a few hours).

## Why can't I see my rewards?
It takes some time for rewards to come through, particularly if you have a small number of tokens and trading volume is low.
